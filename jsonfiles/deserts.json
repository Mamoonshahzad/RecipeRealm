    "itemDescription": "\nFor the Pie Crust:\nPrepare the Dough:\nIn a food processor, combine the flour, salt, and sugar.\nAdd the chilled butter cubes and pulse until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.\nGradually add ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time, and pulse until the dough comes together. Be careful not to overmix.\nDivide the dough into two equal portions, shape into disks, wrap in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.\n\nFor the Apple Filling:\n\nPrepare the Apples:\nPeel, core, and slice the apples.\nToss the apple slices with lemon juice to prevent browning.\n\nMix the Filling:\nIn a large bowl, combine the sliced apples, granulated sugar, brown sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla extract. Toss until the apples are evenly coated.\n\nFor Assembly:\nPreheat the Oven:\n\nPreheat your oven to 425°F (220°C).\n\nRoll Out the Dough:\nOn a lightly floured surface, roll out one disk of pie dough into a circle to fit your pie dish.\n\nLine the Pie Dish:\nPlace the rolled-out dough into a 9-inch pie dish, leaving any excess hanging over the edges.\n\nAdd the Apple Filling:\nSpoon the prepared apple filling into the pie crust, leveling it with a spatula.\n\nDot with Butter:\nCut 1 tablespoon of butter into small pieces and dot the top of the apple filling.\n\nRoll Out the Second Dough:\nRoll out the second disk of pie dough and place it over the apple filling.\n\nSeal and Crimp the Edges:\nTrim excess dough, leaving a slight overhang. Fold the edges of the top and bottom crusts together and crimp to seal.\n\nMake Vents:\nCut a few slits in the top crust to allow steam to escape.\n\nEgg Wash:\nIn a small bowl, beat the egg with milk or cream to create an egg wash. Brush the top crust with the egg wash.\n\nSprinkle Sugar:\nSprinkle a little sugar over the top crust for a golden finish.\n\nBake:\nPlace the pie on a baking sheet and bake in the preheated oven for 45-55 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown, and the filling is bubbly.\n\nCool:\nAllow the pie to cool for at least 2 hours before slicing. This helps the filling set."  },
